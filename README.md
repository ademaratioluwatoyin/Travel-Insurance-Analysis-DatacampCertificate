# Travel Insurance Analysis (Data Analyst Certificate - DataCamp)
This project is a case study from the DataCamp's Data Analyst Certification process.

I was given data of a travel insurance company containining information about customers- those who have bought travel insurance and non-customers- those who have received quote but are yet to purchase travel insurance. The data captured in the dataset include:

1. Age
2. Annual Income
3. Number of family members
4. Whether they have chronic disease
5. Whether they are frequent travellers
6. Whether they have travelled abroad
7. Whether they have travel insurance or not

This repository contains the dataset, a google colab notebook of my analytics where I used pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to analyze and visualize the data.
It also contains a powerpoint presentation of my final report.
